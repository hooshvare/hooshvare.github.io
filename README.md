## Research Scope

Our research scope entails building AI solutions for localized needs. Most of this effort, for the time being, hinges around building Persian-specific solutions for different NLP tasks and problems. Since the resources for Persian is severely limited, we have made it our mission to fill the gap and enrich this area with strong and credible research resource and materials.
